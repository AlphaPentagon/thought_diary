# Thought Diary

A simple CBT thought diary app.

View the demo [here](https://thought-diary.netlify.app/)

## Plan

The MVP will be that people can log their thoughts as a series of responses to questions and then access these from a dashboard, with the option to update or delete each individual thought. The design will be clean and clear.

I plan to use the Mern stack for this project. I have not used MongoDB before so this is a good chance to learn something new. I am excited to practise my backend skills and implement custom authentication. I also plan to use Boostrap for styling which I have not used previously.
