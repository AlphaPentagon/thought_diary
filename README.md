# Thought Diary

A simple CBT thought diary app.

The MVP will be that people can log their thoughts as a series of responses to questions and then access these from a dashboard. There will be a login and logout feature. The design will be nice and clean and clear.

I plan to use the Mern stack for this project. I have not used MongoDB before so this is a good chance to learn something new. I am excited to practise my backend skills and implement custom authentication. I also plan to use a component library as well, something I have limited experience with.
